# Features-of-Successful-Kickstarter-Projects

Building a model to predict the outcome of a project will benefit the creators and backers but
uncovering the features of successful project will increase the number of successful projects created. In
this study we look at Kickstarter data to identify features that contribute towards the success of a
project. We analyse the data to uncover patterns and identify new features. We will then test the
features on the following classification models, Random forest and XgBoost, to discover the feature
importance.
